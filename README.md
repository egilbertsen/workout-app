App for logging workouts

## Description

This app allows a user to log several workouts, tracking excercises, weight, sets/reps, duration, and distance, as appropriate by excercise type.

The user can decide between creating a new workout or resuming thier old work out.

My contribution to this project was the backend, powered by a mongoDB.
